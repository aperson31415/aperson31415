Hello, I am me.
- I’m interested in competitive programming, coding, and research maths, and maths olympiads
- You will probably not reach me (even though it's kinda easy to)
- Pronouns: Me
- Fun fact: Aiyeugheauxxzeigh leighquaxeighkhe ghweauxgheiscieuxszeighse! Eiyiauxfgh you aundearstarnde, you aierre vaireiey scmarrt.
- About my github: Lots of old projects have been removed because they either have a little bit of personal information, have outdated stuff, are now broken, are not good enough quality, or I'm just not interested in the area any more (like a bunch of ml, and then neural network stuff, and lecture notes). Also, my contribution number is probably super high because I add in my files for ORAC solutions 1-by-1, and MO's in groups of around maybe 20.
